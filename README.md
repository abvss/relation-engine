## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to use library.


### Prerequisites

* Linux _(or any other OS where java can be installed)_
* Java 8/11
* Maven
* Lombok installed on your Eclipse/intellij

### Using Relation Engine Service

Import the dependancy
```
<dependency>
        <groupId>in.abvss</groupId>
	<artifactId>relation-engine</artifactId>
	<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>

Use the service, easy :)

```
@Autowired
RelationEngineService relationEngineService;
...
...
...

...
relationEngineService.setMemberList(memberList);      
MutableDirectedGraph g = service.createRelationshipGraph();   

```


### Running the tests
For shooting everything once. :)

```
mvn clean verify package test spotbugs:check pmd:pmd checkstyle:check javadoc:javadoc
```

### Junit
Relation Engine have lots of testcases to cover and code coverage is **89%**
```
mvn clean verify test
```

### Coding style tests
I'm a contributor to Apache Commons Text and love the checkstyle we use there. I have used same to develop this project.
https://github.com/apache/commons-text

```
mvn clean verify checkstyle:check
```
### Spotbug and pmd
```
mvn clean verify spotbugs:check pmd:pmd
```
### Javadoc
For API documentation.
```
mvn clean verify javadoc:javadoc
```
### Site
Using default site generation by mvn.
```
mvn site:run
```
and point your browser to http://0.0.0.0:8080/, All info, javadoc, Reports at one place :)
